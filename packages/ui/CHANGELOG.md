## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- fcc920b: Fix unresolved `catalog:` protocol in published `dependencies`. The `0.1.0` tarball on npm declared `"@floating-ui/dom": "catalog:"` literally instead of a concrete semver range, which broke installs in any non-pnpm setup. The release workflow now publishes via `pnpm publish -r`, which resolves `catalog:` and `workspace:` protocols at pack time.
